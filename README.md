### Project Brief

Your app must:

* **Use Mongo, Express and Node** to build an API and a **Angular front-end app** that consumes it
* **Create an API using at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those model
* **API must include tests for the authentication and resful routes
* **Consume your own API** by making your front-end app with **Angular** using some 3rd party dependencies such as **ui.router** and **ng-resource**
* **Add authentication to your API** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible
* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A Anguar front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file**

### [](https://github.com/weresquirrel/wdi-third-project#where-next)Where next?

How can the app be extended and improved:

- making some of the schema's editable:
 * currently can't update profile information
 * currenlty can't delete events or profile

- add modals:
 * like when an event is made

- have a album for the event:
  * guest to add pictures to an event.

- Improving the code:
  * I am certain that there are areas of my code to be more efficient and dryer.
  * the code could be refactored further.

- Improve user experience:
  * Futher improve how information is presented in order to have a better user experience.
  * Friend people

- Utilize more APIs:
  * Use and API to shop for items guest are bringing
